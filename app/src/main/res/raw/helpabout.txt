INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

This app is based on the awesome JMDICT file, the pivot language of which is Japanese. This means its main purpose is to tell you what Japanese words mean in another language. The Japanese is always concise, while the English and German is at times very heavily commented. Please keep that restraint in mind. When you use the dictionary for queries in reverse (e.g. from English to Japanese), the results you get can still be helpful, but please be very careful. Queries omitting the pivot language Japanese (e.g. straight from English to German) may - as a side effect - happen to work out in individual cases, but are even more strongly discouraged as that is just not what the project is aiming for.

To run a query, type the word you are looking for into the text box (top left) then click on the search button or press the enter key to perform a search. Or just wait a second and a half without making any input to have a search done automatically.
For simplicity, the application always runs a query through its entire data. You do not need to specify a language combination. The check boxes indicate the languages in which your search result will be displayed. Regarding Japanese, you can select or unselect annotations that will be displayed in curly brackets or not.

In many or even most cases, a given annotation will simply apply to all potential senses a query yields. But some tags in the original JMDICT file are specific to one sense element among two or more sense elements within an individual dictionary entry. At this point (Version 2.0), both in order to accelerate lookups and save storage, this app relies on the JMDIC file without preserving its semantic ordering of within an entry, so the internal relationship between tag and specific sense is lost so in those complex cases, you will have to figure out by yourself which tag applies to what usage. The position of a tag in the curly bracket has no significance.

By touching [X] (top right) you delete whatever is in the text box.

The radio boxes set either of the following search methods: In case [☆] is selected the application looks for exact, 100% matches only. This is the fastest type of search. Use it whenever you know exactly what you are looking for.Y

Please avoid using the other options unless necessary - depending on what processor you have they will be much much slower. The application offers you these options even at the risk of annoying you because in the event that you do not know exactly what you want to query (e.g. if you only know a part of a longer Kanji compound and cannot remember the rest) each of these options can be very useful and the results worth waiting a few seconds.

In case you select [☆...], the application lists up to 50 entries to the extent that they start with the character string you entered.

[...☆] will give you up to 50 entries that end with your search characters.

Finally [...☆...] will look up up to 50 entries that include the character string you look for.

Each result gets a number and the language is indicated in square brackets ([J] for Japanese, [E] for English, [G] for German). In general, please try different search words and options if the output is not satisfactory at first. The JMDICT dictionary file is very large and contains words that are hardly relevant in actual living Japanese. In particular, please avoid rare Katakana expressions (e.g. カーサ for house). The results are not sorted (e.g. according to data on how often a word is assumed to be used by some web scraping bot etc.), so please scroll through all your results to find the best match to your query individually. Whatever you find on top of the list just might not be useful at all. You can long-click and copy any text and paste it for searching elsewhere if you like (your browser, other apps...).

LICENSES

This application is delivered as is and made available without any warranty whatsoever as to its accuracy or suitability for a particular use. No risk is assumed: the entire risk of loss, damage, unsatisfactory performance (and any other risk) rests with you, the user. In no event shall anybody be liable for any loss, damage or expense arising from the use (or inability of use) of this program, including, but not limited to, injury, claims, suits or causes of action involving alleged infringement of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or unfair competition. By using this program, you agree to indemnify anybody from and against all claims, liabilities, losses, causes of action, damages, judgements, and expenses, including the reasonable cost of attorney's fees and court costs, for injuries or damages to the person or property of third parties, including, without limitations, consequential damages and economic losses, that arise out of or in connection with your use, modification or distribution of this application, its output or any accompanying documentation.

This application is based on the EDICT dictionary file. The EDICT dictionary file is the property of the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group, and is used in conformance with the Group's licence.

The EDICT file has the following URL: http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/edict.html

The full license code can be viewed under the following URL: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode 

The full text of both these legal documents governing EDICT is also displayed below.

Please note that this refers to the Japanese and English only. The German contained in the JMDICT file and also in this application is not owned by the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group and governed by a separate licence with a copyleft mindset (restricting commercial use) that caps monetization to a certain measure based on the cost of distribution ("Kosten des Verteilungsmediums"). 

And both sides want their licensees to "share alike", meaning either permitting or prohibiting commercial use, respectively. Well which one is it when you put them both together and want to share, you may well ask and the answer is: better not share because it is logically impossible to comply with conflicting share-alike clauses. They really should sort that out.

The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions.
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
a) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
b) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License, (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)), (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the Applicable License), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
c) If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (Attribution Parties) in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., [French translation of the Work by Original Author],  or [Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author]). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
d) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
a) This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
b) Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
a) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
b) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
c) If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
d) No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
e) This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
f) The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
